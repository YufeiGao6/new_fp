Our social media application called **Sticky Post**, which allows users to leave messages and share feelings with friends, families or colleagues.

The users' messages will appear on the screen as sticky posts. The only thing they need to do is just login to their accounts. Then, they can create, edit or delete post(s) freely.  Users can press the like button on any post to let the post-creator knows that people think the same way. 

**Sticky Post** allows users to do all the CRUD functions. What's more, we also store all the data in the database decently and implement multiples of event-based interaction on the front-end. A well-organized server of **Sticky Post** also gives the users a better using experience. More interesting features are waiting for the users to explore!

*Since our final project is updated based on Assignment 4 (Prof. allows us to do that), the screenshots and gifs below shows the differences between A4 and FP, and the new features of FP.*
